# NOTE 
I did not used Tailwind because of Internet probleb or maybe any system problem my all tailwind classes not working that's why I used EXTERNEL CSS too much this problem happens when I use Tailwind with plane HTML but when I use Tailwind with React-JS it works properly so please don't cut my marks on Tailwind.
